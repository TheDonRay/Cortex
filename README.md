# Cortex

Cortex is a small backend project built with **Node.js** and **Express** to learn how to integrate the **OpenAI API** into a real server environment. The goal of this project is to understand how AI models are called, how prompts are handled, and how responses flow through an API.

This project is intentionally simple and focused on learning core concepts rather than building a full product.
